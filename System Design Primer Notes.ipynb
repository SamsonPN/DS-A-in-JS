    "### Application Caching\n",
    "\n",

    "* since data is held in RAM, it is much faster than typical databases where data is stored on disk\n",
    "    - RAM is more limited than disk, so cache invalidation algorithms such as least recently used (LRU) can help invalidate 'cold' entries and keep 'hot' data in RAM\n",
    "* Redis has the following additional features:\n",
    "    - persistence option\n",
    "    - built-in data structures such as sorted sets and lists\n",

    "    - hard to delete a cahced result with complex queries\n",

    "\n",

    "* cache does not interact with storage directly\n",

    "    - look for entry in cache, resulting in a cache miss\n",
    "    - load entry from the database\n",
    "    - add entry to cache\n",
    "    - return entry\n",
    "* memcached is generally used in this manner\n",
    "* subsequent reads of data added to cache are fast\n",
    "* also referred to as lazy loading\n",
    "* only requested data is cached, which avoids filling up cache with data that isn't requested\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages: cache-aside\n",
    "\n",
    "* each cache miss results in three trips, which can cause a noticeable delay\n",
    "* data can become stale if it is updated in the database\n",
    "    - issue is mitigated by setting a time-to-live (TTL) which forces an update of the cache entry, or by using write-through\n",
    "* when a nodefails, it is replaced by a new, empty node, increasing latency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Write-through\n",
    "\n",
    "* application uses the cache as the main data store, reading/writing data to it, while the cache is responsible for reading/writing to the database:\n",
    "    - app adds/updates entry in cache\n",
    "    - cache synchronously writes entry to data store\n",
    "    - return\n",
    "* write-through is a slow overall operation due to the write operation but subsequent reads of just written data are fast\n",
    "* users generally more tolerant of latency when updating data than reading data\n",
    "* data in cache is not stale\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages: write through\n",
    "\n",
    "* when a new node is created due to failure or scaling, the new node will not cache entries until the entry is updated in the database\n",
    "* cache-aside in conjunction with write-through can mitigate this issue\n",
    "* most data written might never be read, which can be minimized with a TTL\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Write-behind (write-back)\n",
    "\n",
    "* application does the following:\n",
    "    - add/update entry in cache\n",
    "    - asynchronously write entry to the data store, improving write performance\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages: write-behind\n",
    "\n",
    "* there could be data loss if the cache goes down prior to its contents hitting the data store\n",
    "* more complex to implement write-behind than it is to implement cache-aside or write-through\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Refresh-ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "* can configure the cache to automatically refresh any recently access cache entry prior to its expiration\n",
    "* can result in reduced latency vs read-through if the cache can accurately predict which items are likely to be needed in the future\n",

    "    - Identify resources (URI in HTTP): use the same URI regardless of any operation\n",

    "* REST is focused on exposing data\n",
    "    - minimizes coupling between client/server\n",
    "    - often used for public HTTP APIs\n",

    "    - actions through verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH\n",
    "* being stateless, REST is great for horizontal scaling and partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages: REST\n",
    "\n",
    "* with REST being focused on exposing data, it might not be a good fit if resources are not naturally organized or accessed in a simple hierarchy\n",
    "    - e.g. returning all updated records from the past hour matching a particular set of events is not easily expressed as a path\n",
    "    - with REST, it is likely to be implemented with a combination of URI path, query parameters, and possibly the request body\n",
    "* REST typically relies on a few verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) which sometimes doesn't fit your use case\n",
    "    - e.g. moving expired documents to the archive folder does not fit cleanly within these verbs\n",
    "* fetching complicated resources with nested hierarchies requires multiple round trips between the client/server to render single views\n",
    "    - e.g. fetching content of a blog entry and the comments on that entry\n",
    "    - for mobile apps operating in variable network conditions, these multiple roundtrips are undesirable\n",
    "* over time, more fields might be added to an API response and older clients will receive all new data fields, even those they don't need\n",
