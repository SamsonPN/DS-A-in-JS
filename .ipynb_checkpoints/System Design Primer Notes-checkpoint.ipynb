    "        * every store, no matter the branch/location, will have the same items for sale\n",

    "    - __partition tolerance__ = the system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures\n",

    "* networks aren't reliable, so you __must support partition tolerance__\n",

    "* aka master-slave failover\n",
    "* heartbeats sent between active and passive server on standby\n",
    "    - if heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active's IP address and resumes service\n",

    "* only the active server handles traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Active-active\n",
    "\n",
    "* aka master-master failover\n",
    "* both servers manage traffic and spread the load between them\n",
    "* if servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers\n",
