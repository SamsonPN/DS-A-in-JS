    "### Techniques:\n",
    "* Master-Slave Replication\n",
    "    - the Master is the original while the Slaves are the copies\n",

    "    - Advantages:\n",
    "        * Better Performance:\n",
    "            - since all writes go to Master and all reads go to Slaves, the reads can be done in parallel which is much faster\n",
    "        * Reliability: if a database is destroyed, the data is still preserved since it was replicated\n",
    "        * High Availability: even if a databse is offline/destroyed, other databases can take its place so that the website is still in operation\n",
    "            - if there is only one slave database and it goes offline, the master database will take over read operations temporarily and a new slave database will be added to take the old one's place\n",
    "            - if there are multiple slave databases, read operations will be directed to the healthy ones and a new slave databse will be added to replace the old\n",
    "            - if the master database is offline, a slave database will be promoted to be the new master and all of the write operations will be directed to the new master. \n",
    "                * a new slave database is added to replace the promoted one\n",
    "                * promoting a new master is pretty complicated since the slave database might not be up to date\n",

    "### Caching Strategies:\n",
    "* Read-through Cache:\n",
    "    - web server tries to read data from cache\n",
    "    - if the cache doesn't have it, it'll query from the database and save it\n",
    "    - it will return that data to the web server and any subsequent reads from the cache for that data will be much faster\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations for using cache:\n",
    "* Decide when to use cache: when data is read frequently but modified infrequently\n",
    "    - cached data is stored in volatile (easily lost) memory and is not good for persisting data\n",
    "    - if the cache fails or restarts, all of the data in that cache is lost\n",
    "* Expiration Policy: once cached data is expired, it should be removed from the cache\n",
    "    - no expiration = stored in memory permanently which is what we don't want\n",
    "    - must find a good expiration time for the data\n",
    "        * if expiration is too long, data becomes stale\n",
    "        * if expiration is too short, must frequently read the database (performance issues)\n",
    "* Consistency: keeping the database and the cache data in sync\n",
    "    - inconsistency can happen when data is modified in the data-store but not in the cahce at the same time\n",
    "    - can be pretty difficult to sync the two up\n",
    "* Mitigating Failures: single cache server can be a potential single point of failure\n",
    "    - to mitigate this, we can have multiple cache servers across different data centers\n",
    "* Eviction Policy: when the cahce is full, any requests to add new items to the cache will also remove an item in the cache as well\n",
    "    - this is called cache eviction\n",
    "    - most popular: LRU (least recently used) cache\n",

    "3. the origin returns image.png to the CDN server which mihgt include an HTTP header Time-To-Live (TTL) which tells it how long the image should be cached for\n",
